## üîç Project Steps

### Step 1: Data Preparation  
Several transformations were applied to the data in Excel to improve its analysis and visualization:

1. **Created a `Revenue` column**  
   Formula: `transaction_qty * unit_price`
   
2. **Created a `Month` column** for easier interpretation  
   Formula: `MONTH(transaction_date)`

3. **Created two columns for the day of the week:**  
   - **`Weekday_num`**: Numeric day of the week using `WEEKDAY(transaction_date)`  
   - **`Weekday_name`**: Abbreviated name of the day using `TEXT(transaction_date, "DDD")`
   
4. **Created an `Hour` column**  
   Formula: `HOUR(transaction_time)`

### Step 2: Pivot Tables Creation  
The following pivot tables were built to summarize and analyze the data:  

1. **Total Revenue by Month**  
   Columns: `Revenue` and `Month`  

2. **Transaction Count by Day of the Week**  
   Columns: `Weekday_name` and `transaction_qty`  

3. **Transaction Count by Product Category**  
   Columns: `product_category` and `transaction_qty`  

4. **Transaction by Hour of Day**  
   Columns: `Hour`, `transaction_qty`.

### Step 3: Data Visualization  

1. **Total Revenue by Month** ‚Äì Line Chart: Ideal for displaying trends over time.  

2. **Transactions by Day of the Week** ‚Äì Column Chart: A column chart clearly highlights differences between weekdays.  

3. **Transactions by Hour of the Day** ‚Äì Column Chart: Useful for identifying peak transaction times during the day.

4. **Transaction Count and Revenue by Product Type (Top 15)**  
   Columns: `product_type`, `transaction_qty`, and `Revenue`
